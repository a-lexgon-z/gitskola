            This is the only dungeon in Battle for Azeroth in which the Alliance and Horde have different versions.
            The differences are mainly cosmetic, with trash & the first boss having different names, however the route towards the first boss is also slightly different.
            This route has the same trash enemies for both Alliance and Horde, and as the route is pretty linear we will not be covering this minor route change in this guide.
            Any large differences between the versions have been noted throughout the guide.</p>
