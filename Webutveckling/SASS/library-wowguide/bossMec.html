        <h1>Atal'Dazar</h1>
        is a max-level dungeon located in Zuldazar. It is available to Level 110 players on Normal difficulty and level 120 players on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+ difficulties.
        
        This guide will outline strategies and important role-based responsibilities for each of the 4 bosses in Atal'Dazar, as well as some tips on particularly threatening trash mobs.
        
        When running this dungeon in Mythic+, additional affixes will be present on the enemies in the dungeon, affecting the way they behave.
        Rewards
        You can complete the achievements  Bringing Hexy Back,  It's Lit! and  Gold Fever towards  Glory of the Wartorn Hero which awards  Reins of the Obsidian Krolusk. These can only be completed on Mythic difficulty.
        
         Hydrocore also has a chance to drop from end-of-dungeon bosses until January 22nd at which point  Tidalcore will start to drop.
        Loot
        Loot drops at ilvl 310 on Normal mode for level 120 players, ilvl 325 on Heroic and ilvl 340 on Mythic.
        
        For Mythic+ Dungeons, loot does not drop per boss. At the end of the dungeon, a special chest will spawn that contains loot from the dungeon, for which the base ilvl increases based on the Mythic Keystone level. The loot is personal, so each player should loot it to see what their reward is. Two pieces of loot are guaranteed and the items will be appropriate to the player's class/spec.
        
        In addition, all loot in Battle for Azeroth is on an ilvl spectrum. Most loot has a base ilvl and a progressively smaller chance to appear as a Warforged version, increasing in intervals of +5 ilvls. Learn more about loot in the BfA Gearing Guide.
        
        Dungeon loot can also be found at random on World Quests, including quests that send you into the dungeon, as well as quests to kill random elites.

        For Mythic+ Dungeons, loot does not drop per boss. At the end of the dungeon, a special chest will spawn that contains epic items from the dungeon's loot table, for which the base ilvl increases based on the Mythic Keystone level. The loot is personal, so each player should loot it to see what their reward is. Two pieces of loot are guaranteed for the party, and the items will be appropriate to the player's class/spec.
        
        In addition, if you successfully complete a Mythic+ dungeon within the time allotted, the Keystone that was used to start the attempt will become upgraded by at least 1 level. The faster you clear the content, the larger the upgrade, up to a maximum of 3 levels higher.
        
        If the party upgrades the keystone by more than one level, they will also receive the corresponding number of loot chests.

        Priestess Alun'za
        Priestess Alun'za Notable Trash Mobs
        There are 6 different trash mobs, arranged in multiple configurations, that you will need to defeat on your way towards Priestess Alun'za.
        
        
        Drag enemies out of the  Bwonsamdi's Mantle zone!
        They cannot be CC'd or Interrupted whilst inside.Dazar'ai Honor Guards simply melee hit the tank and occasionally cast  Fervent Strike, which deals very minor physical damage to the tank.
        
        Dazar'ai Juggernauts frequently cast  Merciless Assault, which causes them to charge to the location of a random player (prioritizing ranged players) and deal high burst damage to anyone within 8 yards.
        Players who react quickly enough are able to dodge this damage by moving away from their location as the Dazar'ai Juggernaut charges towards them.
        Dazar'ai Juggernauts will also buff themselves with  Fanatic's Rage. This cast can interrupted, or the buff can be removed by spells that dispel enrage effects.
        Dazar'ai Confessors have two important 1.5 sec casts that the group should interrupt.
         Mending Word will heal a mob for 25% of its maximum health.
         Bwonsamdi's Mantle spawns a large zone which causes all enemies inside to be immune to crowd control effects, including interrupts, silences, displacements and stuns, lasts 12 seconds.
        If this cast goes through, the tank should attempt to drag any enemies outside of the zone. This can be difficult to achieve, especially for enemies that spam cast spells, such as the Dazar'ai Augur.
        
        Interrupt the  Fiery Enchant cast!Dazar'ai Augurs frequently cast  Wildfire at a random player. This deals a moderate burst of damage and leaves a dispellable magic debuff that deals damage over time.
        Augurs will also channel  Fiery Enchant if a Dazar'ai Juggernaut is nearby. This immobilizes the Juggernaut whilst causing it to spew out lots of fire bolts that land nearby, dealing significant damage to anyone inside.
        It is highly recommended that you save an interrupt for this  Fiery Enchant cast.
        Dazar'ai Colossus's have the  Soulforged Construct passive. This causes them to heal for a large portion of their maximum health and gain a stackable magic buff which increases the damage they deal each time an enemy dies nearby.
        The Dazar'ai Colossus should be killed by the group before any other enemy in the pack due to this powerful passive. Additionally, the Dazar'ai Colossus will channel  Soulburn into a player, dealing moderate damage over time. This spell cannot be interrupted, instead the healer must simply out heal the damage it deals.
        Gilded Priestesses can be found in the area that Priestess Alun'za inhabits. They will cast  Transfusion which will deal damage to the randomly selected player whilst healing the Gilded Priestess.
        A  Tainted Blood pool will spawn nearby before the  Transfusion is cast. If a player is afflicted by  Tainted Blood whilst  Transfusion is being cast upon them, the Gilded Priestess will instead take damage instead of healing.
        Priestess Alun'za Abilities and Strategy
        Priestess Alun'za has four key abilities on normal mode, with an additional two abilities on heroic difficulty and higher.
        
        Throughout the fight, as Priestess Alun'za gains energy, pools of  Tainted Blood will appear around the encounter space.
        Any player that stands within a pool will remove it and gain a 15 second debuff that deals light ticking damage.
        When Priestess Alun'za reaches 100% energy, she will cast  Transfusion. After the 5 second channel, each player will be linked to Alun'za with a beam, dealing moderate ticking damage whilst healing Alun'za for a large portion of her maximum health.
        Players can prevent this healing by gaining the  Tainted Blood debuff before the  Transfusion is cast. This will cause Alun'za to take damage from her  Transfusion cast, instead of healing.
        This is shown visually, as the beams connecting players to Alun'za will turn from a holy gold colour to a dark red blood colour when afflicted with  Tainted Blood.
        There will always be 5  Tainted Blood on the ground before each  Transfusion cast, so players should only take one each to ensure that everyone can counter the healing from  Transfusion.
        
        Make sure everybody has soaked a  Tainted Blood pool when  Transfusion is cast!
        
        
        Priestess Alun'za will occasionally cast  Gilded Claws. This gives her a 12 second magic-dispellable buff that causes her melee attacks to deal 150% physical damage.
        The group should dispel this spell if possible, or the tank should simply use active mitigation throughout the buff if not.
        Priestess Alun'za will also occasionally cast  Molten Gold. This applies a magic debuff to a random player that deals ticking damage over 30 seconds.
        The healer should quickly dispel this debuff to remove this source of damage.
        On Heroic difficulty and higher, Priestess Alun'za will continuously spew out  Corrupted Gold orbs from the two pools of  Molten Gold that are placed on either side of her throne.
        These  Corrupted Gold orbs will travel across the encounter space in a straight line. If a player is hit by an orb they will take a burst of damage and receive a debuff which reduces the damage they deal by 30% for 10 seconds.
        The  Corrupted Gold orbs move slowly, so players shouldn't have a hard time dodging them as they flow throughout the fight.
        Additionally, Priestess Alun'za will summon a Spirit of Gold add. This add will not initially attack players, instead it will seek out the pools of  Tainted Blood and absorb it. After soaking all remaining  Tainted Blood pools, it will then attack players.
        Players should crowd control and kill the Spirit of Gold as soon as possible as it will cause the boss to receive some healing from  Transfusion if it manages to soak any  Tainted Blood pools.
        The Spirit of Gold is susceptible to all forms of crowd control, most notably stuns, displacements and slows.
        The Spirit of Gold always spawns at Priestess Alun'za's throne. The tank should keep Priestess Alun'za at her throne when the add is due to spawn to allow players to cleave damage onto both enemies at once.
            
        On Heroic and Mythic, avoid the  Corrupted Gold orbs!	On Mythic, kill the Spirit of Gold add, cleave the boss!
        Vol'kaal
        Vol'kaal Notable Trash Mobs
        
        Fire is bad.After defeating Priestess Alun'za, the group should move down the staircase. This staircase has masks that spew out  Tiki Blaze, dealing near lethal damage to anyone who is hit.
        Players should be patient and wait for an opening before moving past the tiki masks on the wall. You can see which mask is about to spew fire, as its eyes will light up with fire!
        At the bottom of the staircase, players will be met with 2 Dazar'ai Augurs and 2 Dazar'ai Honor Guards. After dispatching them, clicking on the lever which will lower the spear gate and grant you access to the middle of the instance.
        Players will be met with 5 different trash mobs within this middle section.
        
        Toxic Saurids come in packs of 4-6 and will frequently jump to a random player via their  Leaping Thrash casts. This will deal damage to the player and anyone within 3 yards.
        Players should stack close to one another to help keep these small enemies grouped up, but not so close that the  Leaping Thrash deals any splash damage.
        The Toxic Saurids also have a passive buff called  Poisoned Claws that causes their attacks to deal a small amount of additional nature damage.
        Feasting Skyscreamers are pterodactyl-like enemies that are usually found by themselves perched on top of the surrounding pillars, or surrounded by a pack of Toxic Saurids.
        They will cast  Terrifying Screech, a 2 second interruptible cast that will fear all players for 6 seconds. This ability must be interrupted, as the fear can lead to additional packs being pulled and eventually a wipe.
        Players will find Dinomancer Kish'o and her two animal companions, Monzumi and T'lonja, patrolling the centre of this area. It is possible to skip this patrol by hugging the sides of the circular platform whilst the patrol is stood on the opposite side.
        
        Dinomancer Kish'o will repeatedly cast  Quickshot on the the tank and  Deadeye Aim on a random non-tank player. These casts cannot be avoided and simply deal moderate physical damage to their target that must be topped up by the healer.
        Dinomancer Kish'o will also cast  Dino Might. This 3 second interruptible cast will apply a 10 second magic buff on one of her animal companions which heals them over time. It should be interrupted and if missed, then the  Dino Might buff should be purged instead.
        T'lonja will cast  Frenzied Charge at a random player. This deals damage and stuns all players in the path of the spell for 2 seconds.
        The targeted player should stand still when  Frenzied Charge is cast at them, as this will give other players time to avoid the incoming charge.
        Monzumi will cast  Wild Thrash. This channel deals moderate physical damage to all players within 8 yards.
        Players should not need to move from this ability on Normal/Heroic difficulties, however they may wish to avoid it on high Mythic Keystone levels.
        After passing through this area, the group should move towards the staircase to the north. The group will have to deal with 3 different mandatory trash mobs within this area, with 1 optional trash mob that can be found to the east once the group has ascended the staircase.
        
        
        Move away from allies if afflicted with
         Unstable Hex.The Zanchuli Witch-Doctors will spam cast  Venom Blast at random players, which deals a moderate amount of nature damage to the target.
        Although players can interrupt this spell, the group should not expend all of their interrupts for  Venom Blast, as they will want to interrupt  Unstable Hex as a higher priority.
        Zanchuli Witch-Doctors will also occasionally cast  Unstable Hex. This 1 second cast will apply a 5 second curse debuff on a player.
        The player will be pacified and have their movement speed reduced by 30% for the duration of the debuff.
        Once the debuff expires, it will attempt to spread to anyone else within 8 yards (as shown by the green circle around the afflicted player).
        The debuff will continue to spread until the debuff expires on a player with nobody within 8 yards.
        Players should interrupt this  Unstable Hex cast. If that fails, the afflicted player should move 8 yards away from all other players to ensure that they do not spread this curse around!
        Shieldbearer of Zul enemies will channel  Bulwark of Juju which creates a protective barrier around the Shieldbearer which reduces all incoming damage on enemies by 90%.
        
        Move enemies out of the  Bulwark of Juju
        damage reduction zone or knock the
        Shieldbearers away!
        Over this 5 second period, the Shieldbearers cannot be crowd controlled or interrupted by any means aside from displacements.
        The group should attempt to move other enemies within the pack out of the  Bulwark of Juju to allow continuous damage to be applied. Alternatively, they can knock back or displace the Shieldbearer away from other enemies to achieve a similar result.
        Shieldbearer of Zul enemies will also cast  Shield Bash on the tank or any nearby caster if the tank is not in melee range of the Shieldbearer. This deals moderate physical damage and interrupts any spell casting for 2 seconds.
        The tank should attempt to remain within melee range of these enemies at all times. Alternatively, spell casters should maintain range when fighting the Shieldbearers as to avoid this  Shield Bash.
        Shadowblade Stalker enemies travel in pairs of two whilst in stealth. If the Stalkers engage players in combat first, they will stun their target for 2 seconds. If players engage the Stalkers first, through effects such as AoE damage, the Stalkers will not stun their target.
        Aside from this, the Shadowblade Stalker has a passive  Venom-Tipped Blade buff which causes their melee attacks to occasionally deal additional nature damage.
        This passive is made more deadly when the Stalker casts  Venomfang Strike on the tank, as this deals a burst of damage and causes the tank to take 100% increased nature damage over 8 seconds.
        During this period, the tank should ensure they remain healthy, either by kiting the Stalkers, using crowd control, or by using active mitigation to lessen the incoming damage they are taking.
        The group at this point can progress straight to Vol'kaal However, if the group decides to take any alternative route through this side of the instance, they are likely to face an additional enemy type.
        
        Reanimated Honor Guards are particularly dangerous trash mobs. They are always accompanied by a Reanimation Totem which will continuously heal the Reanimated Honor Guards for 5% of their maximum health every 1 second.
        The group must defeat the Reanimation Totem before any meaningful damage can be done to the Reanimated Honor Guard.
        When the Reanimation Totem dies, the Reanimated Honor Guard will gain the  Rotting Decay passive, which deals high nature damage to all players every 2 seconds until the Reanimated Honor Guard is killed.
        Players must focus their damage into the Reanimated Honor Guard as soon as they gain the  Rotting Decay passive, as otherwise they will quickly be overwhelmed by the incoming damage.
        Aside from this, the Reanimated Honor Guard will cast  Rending Maul on the tank, which deals a burst of Physical damage and applies a 20 second debuff which deals ticking damage.
        The Reanimated Honor Guards cast this frequently enough for the debuff to stack. This is just another reason to quickly kill any Reanimated Honor Guards as soon as the group encounters them.
        Vol'kaal Abilities and Strategy
        Vol'kaal is a two phase encounter. Phase one consists of the group killing of three Reanimation Totems to stop them from healing the boss, whilst phase two consists of quickly killing the boss whilst dodging the multiple Toxic Pools he leaves on the ground.
        Phase One
        During phase one, Vol'kaal has two abilities that he will constantly cast.
        
        
        Move away from the  Toxic Leap landing location!Vol'kaal will mark the location of a random player. After a few moments he will jump to that location via  Toxic Leap, dealing high magic damage and knocking back anyone within 8 yards of the location.
        Players need to simply move out of these locations. To minimize overall group movement, players should attempt to be spread 8 yards at all times.
        Vol'kaal will also stop and channel  Noxious Stench. This interruptible channel will deal ticking damage every 2 seconds over its 4 second channel.
        Each tick of damage will also apply a disease debuff called  Lingering Nausea, which deals ticking damage over 12 seconds. This damage can become very dangerous when the entire group has multiple stacks.
        Players should attempt to interrupt the  Noxious Stench cast as soon as possible. This can be difficult for melee players to achieve, as Vol'kaal is frequently out of range of melee players due to his constant spamming of  Toxic Leap.
        
        On Heroic and Mythic, all three totems
        need to die within 7 seconds of each other!There are three Reanimation Totems in the triangular encounter space, one in each corner. Each totem is buffing Vol'kaal with  Bad Voodoo, healing the boss for 5% of his max health every 0.5 seconds.
        This makes all damage onto Vol'kaal useless whilst the totems are alive. Players must kill these totems as soon as possible so that you can transition into phase two.
        On Heroic difficulty and higher, the three Reanimation Totems will cast  Reanimate when they reach 1 health point. This prevents the totem from dying whilst casting and, upon completion, will heal the totem back to 100% health.
        This cast can only be interrupted if all three totems are casting  Reanimate at the same time. So all totems must be brought to 1 health point within the 7 second cast time of  Reanimate.
        Once the totems have been destroyed, phase two begins.
        Phase Two
        During phase two, Vol'kaal gains the  Rapid Decay buff which causes him to deal a minor amount of damage to himself every 0.8 seconds.
        
        
        Move out of the  Toxic Pools!
        This buff also increases the physical damage Vol'kaal deals by 50% and also causes him to spew out  Toxic Pools until he dies.
        The  Toxic Pools land on top of, or next to, the location of players. The pools deal high ticking nature damage to anyone who stands within them, and the pools themselves last for ~90 seconds.
        As the space in the room is limited, it is recommended that the tank keeps the boss at the edge of the encounter space, moving slightly each time the melee DPS or the tank need to dodge a  Toxic Pool.
        During this time, ranged players should stand in the middle of the encounter space, as to bait the  Toxic Pools away from the melee/tank group.
        Although Vol'kaal will no longer cast  Toxic Leap during phase two, he will still cast  Noxious Stench. This is far easier to interrupt, as all members of the group are likely to be within interrupt range of the boss.
        Rezan
        Rezan Notable Trash Mobs
        Once Vol'kaal is dead, the group should backtrack down the staircase and then jump down into the Sacrificial Pits below. If players follow this route, they will encounter no trash enemies along the way.
        If the group decides to take a different route towards Rezan, they will encounter trash enemies that have already been covered in the sections above!
        Rezan Abilities and Strategy
        
        Avoid running into/dragging the boss
        over the bone piles during the boss encounter!Rezan is a single phase encounter that relies on good boss and group positioning to deal with his abilities.
        
        Multiple  Ancient Dry Bones piles are scattered throughout Rezan's encounter space. If a player moves into one of these piles, they will become slowed by 30% for 2 seconds via  Pile of Bones, whilst also causing a Reanimated Raptor to spawn.
        These Reanimated Raptors will melee attack the target they have threat on, so the tank must be quick at gaining threat on them once they become active.
        Players should be constantly mindful of the  Ancient Dry Bones piles, as causing a Reanimated Raptor to spawn can cause your tank to become overwhelmed by the incoming damage.
        On Heroic difficulty and higher, Rezan will also cause the Reanimated Raptors to spawn from the  Ancient Dry Bones piles when he walks over them.
        Players should attempt to maneuver Rezan in such a way that minimizes the amount of adds that spawn.
        
        Run out of line of sight when  Terrifying Visage
        is cast to avoid being feared for 6 seconds!Rezan will cast  Terrifying Visage, causing all players within line of sight to be feared for 6 seconds. This fear can be dispelled.
        Rezan should be positioned next behind one of the pillars either in the centre of the encounter space, or more favourably, at the edge of the encounter space, as fewer  Ancient Dry Bones piles are present in this area.
        As soon as Rezan begins his  Terrifying Visage cast, all players should move to the opposite side of the pillar to create a line of sight barrier between themselves and the boss.
        Shortly after Rezan finishes his  Terrifying Visage cast, he will cast  Pursuit on a player. This consists of a 3 second cast which alerts the targeted player that they are about to be chased, followed by a 12 second chase!
        If Rezan catches up to the player, he will cast  Devour on them, dealing near lethal physical damage over 8 seconds.
        Players should attempt to kite Rezan as to dodge the incoming  Devour. If a player is caught, they should use any defensive cooldown they have whilst the healer spam heals them.
        Players need to be careful not to run into the  Ancient Dry Bones piles whilst kiting Rezan during his  Pursuit, as the 30% slow from  Pile of Bones will likely result in the player getting caught.
        Rezan will also cast  Serrated Teeth on the tank. This will deal a burst off damage to the tank and apply a debuff which increases physical damage taken by 50%.
        The tank during this time should use active mitigation to try to lessen the extra incoming damage.
        Rezan will also cast  Tail when any players are stood behind him.
        This will deal a small amount of physical damage and knock back players that are stood behind Rezan.
        Player should do their best not to stand behind Rezan at any point, as the knock back from this ability may cause them to accidentally spawn extra Reanimated Raptors from the  Ancient Dry Bones piles.
        Yazma
        Yazma Notable Trash Mobs
        Once Rezan is dead, ascend the staircase on either the Northeast or Southeast of the Sacrificial Pits and then head through the middle section towards the west. The group will encounter packs of Toxic Saurids, a few Feasting Skyscreamers, as well as Dinomancer Kish'o and her animal companions if there were not killed off earlier.
        
        If you have killed the previous three bosses, upon reaching the waterfall at the western side of the central platform, it will stop flowing and the wall will turn into a staircase.
        As the group ascends up the staircase,  Echoes of Shadra spiders will be flowing in the opposite direction.
        Running into a spider will deal a burst of damage to anyone within 3 yards and create a pool of  Shadowy Remains, which deals high ticking damage and slows your movement by 30%, so do your best to dodge them.
        
        Beware the spiders as you climb the last staircase!
        Once you reach the top of the staircase, you will now be able to engage Yazma.
        Yazma Abilities and Strategy
        Yazma will cast  Skewer on the tank, dealing a high burst of physical damage.
        Tanks must be attentive and quick to use active mitigation, as the ability has a 1.5 second cast.
        Yazma will also cast  Wracking Pain on a random non-tank player. This interruptible 2.5 second cast deals a initial burst of shadow damage whilst leaving a curse debuff which deals ticking damage over 6 seconds.
        This ability should be interrupted as much as possible, just to ensure that incoming group damage is kept at a minimum. Curse dispels should be used if the  Wracking Pain cast happens to go through.
        
        Empowered spiders will seek players out!
        Make sure to move away!Throughout the fight Yazma will summon  Echoes of Shadra spiders.
        These spiders will move randomly around the encounter space most of the time, however some will become empowered occasionally, growing in size and gaining a purple aura around them.
        During this empowerment, these spiders will chase down a player until the empowerment times out a few seconds later.
        If a player touches a spider, empowered or not, they will receive a burst of damage which splashes to within 3 yards and a pool of  Shadowy Remains will spawn at that location, which deals high ticking damage and slows movement speeds by 30%, just like the spiders on the staircase before the encounter.
        Players need to actively avoid these spiders to ensure that they keep the room free of as many  Shadowy Remains pools as possible.
        Yazma's most impactful ability is  Soulrend. Yazma will target a single player and place a purple arrow above their head.
        After 5 seconds she will spawn a Soulspawn add at the location of that player. The Soulspawn will attempt to move directly towards Yazma.
        If the Soulspawn reaches Yazma it will explode, applying a debuff which deals high ticking damage over 21 seconds to the group called  Soulfeast.
            
        Move away from the boss
        when targeted by  Soulrend!	CC and kill the add that
        appears from  Soulrend!
        
        Group up when all players are targeted
        by  Soulrend at once!The Soulspawn must be killed before it reaches Yazma. The player initially targeted by  Soulrend should move far away from Yazma to increase the distance the Soulspawn has to travel.
        All DPS should then focus on killing the add whilst using crowd control spells to slow down its progress. Stuns, roots, displacements, slows and hard crowd control spells such as Paralysis all work and should be utilized.
        If the add does happen to reach Yazma, the healer should use cooldowns to combat the incoming damage from  Soulfeast, whilst all players use personal defensive cooldowns to assist the healer.
        On Heroic difficulty and above, all non-tank players will be targeted by  Soulrend at once.
        To combat this, all four players should stack at a preassigned point, far away from Yazma, when the ability is being cast.
        This will spawn all four Soulspawns on top of one another, allowing the group to quickly crowd control and kill the adds.
        On Mythic difficulty, players targeted by  Soulrend will also be afflicted with  Soul Link. This causes a portion of the damage dealt to their Soulspawn to be duplicated back to them.
        This damage isn't particularly high, however healers should note that all non-tank players will be taking some damage whilst their Soulspawns are being damaged.</p>
